# NIPS2016
It contains my NIPS work for general multi-dimension transformation and one-dimension measurement error correction.

It has two files "hypothesis-testing-in-unsupervised-domain-adaptation-with-applications-in-alzheimers-disease-code.zip" and "one-dim_measurement_error_correction_special_case.zip".

The first one is for general multi-dimension transformation. The second one is for a special case when researchers want to correct measurement error of biomarkers which is usually one dimension. This method is more robust compared to simple scaling and it offers a p-value for the significance of the correction.
